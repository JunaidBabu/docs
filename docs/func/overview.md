# Overview

High-level C-like language FunC is used to program smart contracts on TON.

FunC is a domain-specific statically typed language. FunC programs are compiled into Fift assembler code, which generates corresponding bytecode for the TON Virtual Machine. Further this bytecode (actually a tree of cells, like any other data in TON Blockchain) can be used for creating a smart contract in the blockchain or can be run on a local instance of TVM.
